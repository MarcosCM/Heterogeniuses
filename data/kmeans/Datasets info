FILES AND DATA DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each file contains 10000 samples (points) with a given number of dimensions: 10D, 20D, 40D, 80D, 160D, 320D, 640D
File format: each a line contains the space separated values for each dimension of a point. The lines are selarated by '\n'.
Datatype: float
Number of clusters recommended for testing the algorithm: the data was generated for 100 different clusters, but any number of clusters bewteen 2 and about 1000 should be ok.
